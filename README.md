# What is JavaScript?
java Script is a dynamically typed programming lang primarily used for adding interactivity dynamic content and behavior to websites and applications and we called a single third lang.
# Who invented JavaScript?
JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.

**Scripting**:
Javascript executes the client-side script in the browser.

**Interpreter**:
The browser interprets JavaScript code.

**Event Handling:**
Events are actions. Javascript provides event-handling options.

**Light Weight:**
  As Javascript is not a compiled language, source code never changes to byte code before running time. Low-end devices can also run Javascript because of its lightweight feature.
  
**Case Sensitive:**
  In Javascript, names, variables, keywords, and functions are case-sensitive.
  
**Control Statements:**
   Javascript has control statements like if-else-if, switch case, and loop. Users can write complex code using these control statements.

**Objects as first-class Citizens:**
   Javascript arrays, functions, and symbols are objects which can inherit the Object prototype properties. Objects being first-class citizens means Objects can do all tasks.

**Supports Functional Programming:**
    Javascript functions can be an argument to another function, can call by reference, and can assign to a variable.

**Dynamic Typing:**
    Javascript variables can have any value type. The same variable can have a string value, an integer value, or any other.

**Client-side Validations:**
    Javascript client-side validations allow users to submit valid data to the server during a form submission.

**Platform Independent:**
    Javascript will run in the same way in all systems with any operating system.

**Async Processing:**
    Javascript async-await and promise features provide asynchronous nature. As the processes run in parallel, it improves processing time and responsiveness.

**Prototype-based:**
    Javascript follows 'Object.prototype' functions instead of class inheritance.

**Nullish Coalescing Operator (??):**
    The nullish coalescing operator returns the right side operand if the left side operand is null. If the left operand is not 'null', the operator returns the left side operand value. This operator helps to 
     avoid Boolean operator errors.

**Logical nullish assignment (??=):**
It is the shorthand of

          result=left??right;

**Styling Console Log:**
Javascript consoles can have styles. For example, see the block below.

          console.log('%cText %cValue', 'color:black; cursor:pointer', 'color: green;');

The first set of styles applies to the first string with %c, and the second %c gets the second style set for the second string.

**Object Shorthand:**
Object shorthand can save space and time by allowing users to use the same name for assigning variables and key values.
